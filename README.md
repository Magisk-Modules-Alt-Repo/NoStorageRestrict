Removes the restriction when selecting folders (Downloads/Android) through the file manager on Android 11 and higher

Due to the nature of the Magisk version (replacing APKs) it may not work and result in crashes for some users, in those cases the Xposed version is more recommended.

# Requirements

- Android 11 or higher

### v5.0
- Fix crashes 
### v3.0
- Add Android 13 support
- Add Fox Module Manager support
